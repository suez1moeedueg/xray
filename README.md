# X-Ray Proxy

X-Ray Proxy is a lightweight, multi-threaded HTTP/HTTPS proxy server implemented in Python. This project serves as a basic example of how to create a transparent proxy that can handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

## Features

- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS connections
- Multi-threaded design for handling multiple connections simultaneously
- Parses incoming requests to determine target host and port
- Establishes connections to target servers on behalf of clients
- Facilitates bidirectional communication between clients and servers

## How It Works

1. The proxy listens for incoming connections on a specified host and port.
2. For each new connection, a separate thread is spawned to handle the client.
3. The client's request is parsed to determine the target server and port.
4. A connection is established with the target server.
5. Two additional threads are created to handle bidirectional data flow between the client and the server.
6. For HTTPS connections, the socket is wrapped with SSL.

## Usage

1. Run the script on your local machine:
2. 2. Configure your browser or application to use `127.0.0.1:8080` as the proxy server.

## Limitations and Disclaimer

This is a basic implementation intended for educational purposes. It lacks many features of a production-ready proxy, such as:

- Robust error handling
- Logging
- Security measures (e.g., authentication, encryption)
- Performance optimizations

**Do not use this in a production environment without significant improvements.**

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the proxy or add features are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes/additions.
